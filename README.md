## Comparing robustness of MAE MSE and RMSE

Article: *Comparing robustness of MAE MSE and RMSE* [[EN]](https://towardsdatascience.com/comparing-robustness-of-mae-mse-and-rmse-6d69da870828)

Explains how MAE, MSE and RMSE metrics for regression evaluation are affected by the presence of outliers, then performs an experiment to illustrate this effect.
