## Como funcionam as CNNs 

Article: *Como funcionam as Redes Neurais Convolucionais (CNNs)* [[PT-BR]](https://medium.com/@vinicius_trevisan/como-funcionam-as-redes-neurais-convolucionais-cnns-71978185c1)

Fundamentals  of CNNs, and a quick explanation of how they work and how features such as kernel size, stride and padding affect their output.

## Comparing robustness of MAE MSE and RMSE

Article: *Comparing robustness of MAE MSE and RMSE* [[EN]](https://towardsdatascience.com/comparing-robustness-of-mae-mse-and-rmse-6d69da870828)

Explains how MAE, MSE and RMSE metrics for regression evaluation are affected by the presence of outliers, then performs an experiment to illustrate this effect.
